      I was always <a>fascinated</a> by even the most simplest of algorithms, so
      I decided I should make a simulation for one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, I made a <a>simulation for Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>,
      where a Knight on a chessboard finds one of the shortest paths.

      Made with: <a>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</a>.

      I tried my hand with <a>Test Driven Development</a> during this project
      using <a>Jest</a>, it is not 100% tested, but for the inital development
      it came in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made with: <a>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</a> and a little bit of <a>Jest</a>{" "}
      for testing.

      I took upon this project to learn <a>React</a> and it was very useful to

      This was my very <a>first bigger project</a> which I opted to do in{" "}
      <a>Java</a> since I didn't know JavaScript. For the GUI part, I used{" "}
      <a>JavaFX library</a> coupled with SceneBuilder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was made to ease my organization of university studies, which I{" "}
      <a>still use</a> in my day to day life.

      Main purpose of this project was to <a>see differences</a> between Java
      and JavaScript when programming a very similar project.
