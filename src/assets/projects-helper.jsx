      I was always <a>fascinated</a> by even the most simplest of algorithms, so
      I decided I should make a simulation for one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, I made a <a>simulation for Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>,
      where a Knight on a chessboard finds one of the shortest paths.

      it came in handy.

      This was made to ease my organization of university studies, which I{" "}

      Main purpose of this project was to <a>see differences</a> between Java
